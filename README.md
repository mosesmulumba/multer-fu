it is always good for the form to be able to capture data from the user 
and the keep it somewhere in the backend/ background database that's why 
one can create a form with that functionality using the middleware multer,
with this module one can determine where to store the files using the 
destination attribute and also can determine the naming of the stored file
using the filename attribute.
